<a id="Intro" class="anchor" href="#Intro" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Before I dive into the explanation, I wanted to say I did not do this myself. I had two great partners, Adam and Gavriel, with whom I worked on this project. There was no way this could have been done by one person, and I just wanted to clarify that this was a team effort.</p>
<p>So you might be asking, "what even does this do? What is it?" and it's really quite simple. This is a website of a made up record label, called HAG Records (HAG stands for Hursh Adam Gavriel).</p>
<p>Our database contains information about 3 primary entities, artists, producers, and executives. For an artist, we store information about their discography, which includes songs and albums, the musical act(s) they belong to, and the years left on their contract with HAG Records. For a producer, who is responsible for producing records for artists, we store how many years left on their contract with HAG Records. For an executive, as well as for artists and producers, we store their personal information such as phone, SSN, and salary (obviously made up, we don't have that information). Executives are responsible for signing hot artists, dropping artists putting out whack joints, and making sure the atmosphere of HAG Records is one that supports the label’s reputation as the #1 hit factory in the world.
Our website, (formerly!) located at cs336-5.cs.rutgers.edu, allows a user to view the contents of the database from the perspective of a general user, an artist, a producer or an executive, each of which having different read privileges which is discussed in more detail below. We should note that a general user is not an entity in our database.</p>

   <h3>
<a id="Privileges" class="anchor" href="#Privileges" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Types of Users and Their Privileges</h3>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> In order to view all of the data accessible by one user, leave all the text fields blank.</p>
<p><u>General User</u></p>
<p>General Users are unable to query (1) <b>first name</b>, (2) <b>last name</b>, (3) <b>genre</b></p>
<p>General Users are able to query (1) <b>artist</b>, (2) <b>album</b>, (3) <b>song name</b></p>
<p>The general user represents the general public, those who are not employees of the record label. They are the type of user that is most limited in the types of queries that they are allowed to perform on the database. A general user may be a fan of an artist on the HAG Records roster who wants to discover more songs by them. They are permitted to search by artist, album and song name.<br>Examples of queries that they are not allowed to perform include first name, last name, and genre. HAG Records has determined that first and last name is privileged information, which should not be visible to the general public. Genre is a restricted query to satisfy artists’ requests not to be associated with a genre by their fans, which they believe stifles their creative potential.</p>
